    Do all the following while lifeLikeMetersCounter is more than 0
        For the number of iterations equal to the lengtgh of day that is specified by the input
            Find the number of days in the "current" month (reletive to the start date)  
            If this is the first iteration 
                Set the number of days left in the month to the differance between the given start date and total days in the month
                Initiate the countdown with the number of days left in the month
            Store the result of isLastDayOfTheMonth()
            Store translated date values
            Store the base String template for the Readings
            For the number of Readings per day 
                If this is the first section of data for a row of intervals (Interval row segment % Readings per day = 0) 
                    Set the first part of the row to the {{interval-length,readings-per-line}}
                    Turn over the counter (i.e. if this is not the first round of the loop then start the counter over at 0)
                    Increment the counter 
                    Increment the intervalLengthTimeValue by the interval length value (i.e. 100 for 1 hr, 30 for 1/2 hr etc.)
                If it is the last day of the month check to see how to increment the month value and year value
                    If the month is not December
                        Add one to the month
                        Set year to the year
                    Else 
                        Set month to January
                        Set year to year + 1
                    If Using the UTC Offset 
                        Find the point at which the date time string is transitioned to the abutting day, this is at the 18th interval for 24 interval/day
                        reset intervalLengthTimeValue
                    If not using the UTC Offset
                        Find the point at which the date time string is transitioned to the abutting day, this is at the 23rd interval for 24 interval/day  
                        reset intervalLengthTimeValue
                    Start a new countdown for the next month
                Else update the intervalLengthTimeValue with the transitioned date time
                Add a comma to the row unless this is the last segment
                If genRandomLifeLikeData is set to true
                    Create a value for the interval
                    Put the value in a list
                    If it is the last day
                        Add up the intervals and put them in the cumulativeReadingValues
                        Clear intervalValues
                Else 
                    Just divide the dailyRegisterRead by the readingsPerDay 
                Add values to the meterText
                Add the correct interval value to the intervalLengthTimeValue
                Push the row into the monthList
                Update dd dayOfTheMonthCount and countDown
                If isLastDayOfMonth is true
                    update the date
            Add the cumulativeReadingValues to the cumulativeReadingValuesCollection
            Clear the cumulativeReadingValues and intervalValue
            Update the lifeLikeMetersCounter
            Reset the yyyy mm dd hh
    Create the meter numbers and add them to a list
    Combinde the Register Readings with the meterText values and add them to a list
    Feed that list through the file formating loop
    Return that formatted data
